<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of nondramatic musical works, the exclusive rights provided by clauses (1) and (3) of section 106, to make and to distribute phonorecords of such works, are subject to compulsory licensing under the conditions specified by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Availability and Scope of Compulsory License in General.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility for compulsory license.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Conditions for compulsory license</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person may by complying with the provisions of this section obtain a compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work, including by means of digital phonorecord delivery. A person may obtain a compulsory license only if the primary purpose in making phonorecords of the musical work is to distribute them to the public for private use, including by means of digital phonorecord delivery, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) phonorecords of such musical work have previously been distributed to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner of the work, including by means of digital phonorecord delivery; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a digital music provider seeking to make and distribute digital phonorecord deliveries of a sound recording embodying a musical work under a compulsory license for which clause (i) does not apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the first fixation of such sound recording was made under the authority of the musical work copyright owner, and the sound recording copyright owner has the authority of the musical work copyright owner to make and distribute digital phonorecord deliveries embodying such work to the public in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the sound recording copyright owner, or the authorized distributor of the sound recording copyright owner, has authorized the digital music provider to make and distribute digital phonorecord deliveries of the sound recording to the public in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Duplication of sound recording</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person may not obtain a compulsory license for the use of the work in the making of phonorecords duplicating a sound recording fixed by another, including by means of digital phonorecord delivery, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such sound recording was fixed lawfully; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the making of the phonorecords was authorized by the owner of the copyright <!-- PDFPage:79 -->in the sound recording or, if the sound recording was fixed before February 15, 1972, by any person who fixed the sound recording pursuant to an express license from the owner of the copyright in the musical work or pursuant to a valid compulsory license for use of such work in a sound recording.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Musical arrangement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a musical arrangement of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved, but the arrangement shall not change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work, and shall not be subject to protection as a derivative work under this title, except with the express consent of the copyright owner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Procedures To Obtain a Compulsory License.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Phonorecords other than digital phonorecord deliveries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who seeks to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) to make and distribute phonorecords of a musical work other than by means of digital phonorecord delivery shall, before, or not later than 30 calendar days after, making, and before distributing, any phonorecord of the work, serve notice of intention to do so on the copyright owner. If the registration or other public records of the Copyright Office do not identify the copyright owner and include an address at which notice can be served, it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intention with the Copyright Office. The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Digital phonorecord deliveries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who seeks to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) to make and distribute phonorecords of a musical work by means of digital phonorecord delivery&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prior to the license availability date, shall, before, or not later than 30 calendar days after, first making any such digital phonorecord delivery, serve a notice of intention to do so on the copyright owner (but may not file the notice with the Copyright Office, even if the public records of the Office do not identify the owner or the owner's address), and such notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on or after the license availability date, shall, before making any such digital phonorecord delivery, follow the procedure described in subsection (d)(2), except as provided in paragraph (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Record company individual download licenses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(B), a record company may, on or after the license availability date, obtain an individual download license in accordance with the notice requirements described in paragraph (2)(A) (except for the requirement that notice occur prior to the license availability date). A record company that obtains an individual download license as permitted under this paragraph shall provide statements of account and pay royalties as provided in subsection (c)(2)(I).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Failure to obtain license.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Phonorecords other than digital phonorecord deliveries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of phonorecords made and distributed other than by means of digital phonorecord delivery, the failure to serve or file the notice of intention required by paragraph (1) forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license under paragraph (1). In the absence of a voluntary license, the failure to obtain a compulsory license renders the making and distribution of phonorecords actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Digital phonorecord deliveries.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of phonorecords made and distributed by means of digital phonorecord delivery:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) The failure to serve the notice of intention required by paragraph (2)(A) or paragraph (3), as applicable, forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license under such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) The failure to comply with paragraph (2)(B) forecloses the possibility of a blanket license for a period of 3 years after the last calendar day on which the notice of license was required to be submitted to the mechanical licensing collective under such paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Effect of failure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In either case described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i), in the absence of a voluntary license, the failure to obtain a compulsory license renders the making and distribution of phonorecords by means of digital phonorecord delivery actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>General Conditions Applicable to Compulsory License.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Royalty payable under compulsory license.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Identification requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory license obtained under subsection (b)(1) the copyright owner must be identified in the registration or other public records of the Copyright Office. The owner is entitled to royalties for phonorecords made and distributed after being so identified, but is not entitled to recover for any phonorecords previously made and distributed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Royalty for phonorecords other than digital phonorecord deliveries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided by subparagraph (A), for every phonorecord made and distributed under a compulsory license under subsection (a) other than by means of digital phonorecord delivery, with respect to each work embodied in the phonorecord, the royalty shall be the royalty prescribed under subparagraphs (D) through (F), paragraph (2)(A), and chapter 8. For purposes of this subparagraph, a phonorecord is considered &quot;distrib<!-- PDFPage:80 -->uted&quot; if the person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted with its possession.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Royalty for digital phonorecord deliveries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For every digital phonorecord delivery of a musical work made under a compulsory license under this section, the royalty payable shall be the royalty prescribed under subparagraphs (D) through (F), paragraph (2)(A), and chapter 8.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Authority to negotiate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) may negotiate and agree upon the terms and rates of royalty payments under this section and the proportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners, and may designate common agents on a nonexclusive basis to negotiate, agree to, pay or receive such royalty payments. Such authority to negotiate the terms and rates of royalty payments includes, but is not limited to, the authority to negotiate the year during which the royalty rates prescribed under this subparagraph, subparagraphs (E) and (F), paragraph (2)(A), and chapter 8 shall next be determined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Determination of reasonable rates and terms</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Proceedings under chapter 8 shall determine reasonable rates and terms of royalty payments for the activities specified by this section during the period beginning with the effective date of such rates and terms, but not earlier than January 1 of the second year following the year in which the petition requesting the proceeding is filed, and ending on the effective date of successor rates and terms, or such other period as the parties may agree. Any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) may submit to the Copyright Royalty Judges licenses covering such activities. The parties to each proceeding shall bear their own costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Schedule of reasonable rates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The schedule of reasonable rates and terms determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, subject to paragraph (2)(A), be binding on all copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) during the period specified in subparagraph (E), such other period as may be determined pursuant to subparagraphs (D) and (E), or such other period as the parties may agree. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall establish rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller. In determining such rates and terms for digital phonorecord deliveries, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall base their decision on economic, competitive, and programming information presented by the parties, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether use of the compulsory licensee's service may substitute for or may promote the sales of phonorecords or otherwise may interfere with or may enhance the musical work copyright owner's other streams of revenue from its musical works; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the relative roles of the copyright owner and the compulsory licensee in the copyrighted work and the service made available to the public with respect to the relative creative contribution, technological contribution, capital investment, cost, and risk.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Additional terms and conditions.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;License agreements voluntarily negotiated at any time between one or more copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and one or more persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a) shall be given effect in lieu of any determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Subject to clause (ii), the royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (E) and (F) of paragraph (1) shall be given effect as to digital phonorecord deliveries in lieu of any contrary royalty rates specified in a contract pursuant to which a recording artist who is the author of a nondramatic musical work grants a license under that person's exclusive rights in the musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106 or commits another person to grant a license in that musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106, to a person desiring to fix in a tangible medium of expression a sound recording embodying the musical work.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a contract entered into on or before June 22, 1995, and not modified thereafter for the purpose of reducing the royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (E) and (F) of paragraph (1) or of increasing the number of musical works within the scope of the contract covered by the reduced rates, except if a contract entered into on or before June 22, 1995, is modified thereafter for the purpose of increasing the number of musical works within the scope of the contract, any contrary royalty rates specified in the contract shall be given effect in lieu of royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraphs (E) and (F) of paragraph (1) for the number of musical works within the scope of the contract as of June 22, 1995; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a contract entered into after the date that the sound recording is fixed in a tangible medium of expression substantially in a form intended for commercial release, if at the time the contract is entered into, the recording artist retains the right to grant licenses as to the musical work under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Sound recording information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in section 1002(e), a digital <!-- PDFPage:81 -->phonorecord delivery licensed under this paragraph shall be accompanied by the information encoded in the sound recording, if any, by or under the authority of the copyright owner of that sound recording, that identifies the title of the sound recording, the featured recording artist who performs on the sound recording, and related information, including information concerning the underlying musical work and its writer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Infringement remedies.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A digital phonorecord delivery of a sound recording is actionable as an act of infringement under section 501, and is fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the digital phonorecord delivery has been authorized by the sound recording copyright owner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the entity making the digital phonorecord delivery has obtained a compulsory license under subsection (a) or has otherwise been authorized by the musical work copyright owner, or by a record company pursuant to an individual download license, to make and distribute phonorecords of each musical work embodied in the sound recording by means of digital phonorecord delivery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Other remedies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any cause of action under this subparagraph shall be in addition to those available to the owner of the copyright in the nondramatic musical work under subparagraph (J) and section 106(4) and the owner of the copyright in the sound recording under section 106(6).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Liability of sound recording owners</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The liability of the copyright owner of a sound recording for infringement of the copyright in a nondramatic musical work embodied in the sound recording shall be determined in accordance with applicable law, except that the owner of a copyright in a sound recording shall not be liable for a digital phonorecord delivery by a third party if the owner of the copyright in the sound recording does not license the distribution of a phonorecord of the nondramatic musical work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Recording devices and media</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in section 1008 shall be construed to prevent the exercise of the rights and remedies allowed by this paragraph, subparagraph (J), and chapter 5 in the event of a digital phonorecord delivery, except that no action alleging infringement of copyright may be brought under this title against a manufacturer, importer or distributor of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or against a consumer, based on the actions described in such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of rights</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section annuls or limits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the exclusive right to publicly perform a sound recording or the musical work embodied therein, including by means of a digital transmission, under paragraphs (4) and (6) of section 106;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) except for compulsory licensing under the conditions specified by this section, the exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the sound recording and the musical work embodied therein under paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106, including by means of a digital phonorecord delivery; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any other rights under any other provision of section 106, or remedies available under this title, as such rights or remedies exist before, on, or after the date of enactment of the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Exempt transmissions and retransmissions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The provisions of this section concerning digital phonorecord deliveries shall not apply to any exempt transmissions or retransmissions under section 114(d)(1). The exemptions created in section 114(d)(1) do not expand or reduce the rights of copyright owners under paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 106 with respect to such transmissions and retransmissions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) <cap-smallcap>Distribution by rental, lease, or lending</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A compulsory license obtained under subsection (b)(1) to make and distribute phonorecords includes the right of the maker of such a phonorecord to distribute or authorize distribution of such phonorecord, other than by means of a digital phonorecord delivery, by rental, lease, or lending (or by acts or practices in the nature of rental, lease, or lending). With respect to each nondramatic musical work embodied in the phonorecord, the royalty shall be a proportion of the revenue received by the compulsory licensee from every such act of distribution of the phonorecord under this clause equal to the proportion of the revenue received by the compulsory licensee from distribution of the phonorecord under subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii)(II) that is payable by a compulsory licensee under that clause and under chapter 8. The Register of Copyrights shall issue regulations to carry out the purpose of this subparagraph.</p>

Each monthly payment shall be made under oath and shall comply with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation. The Register shall also prescribe regulations under which detailed cumulative annual statements of account, certified by a certified public accountant, shall be filed for every compulsory license under subsection (a). The regulations covering both the monthly and the annual statements of account shall prescribe the form, content, and manner of certification with respect to the number of records made and the number of records distributed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) <cap-smallcap>Notice of default and termination of compulsory license</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a license obtained under paragraph (1), (2)(A), or (3) of subsection (b), if the copyright owner <!-- PDFPage:82 -->does not receive the monthly payment and the monthly and annual statements of account when due, the owner may give written notice to the licensee that, unless the default is remedied not later than 30 days after the date on which the notice is sent, the compulsory license will be automatically terminated. Such termination renders either the making or the distribution, or both, of all phonorecords for which the royalty has not been paid, actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506. In the case of a license obtained under subsection (b)(2)(B), license authority under the compulsory license may be terminated as provided in subsection (d)(4)(E).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) includes the making and distribution of server, intermediate, archival, and incidental reproductions of musical works that are reasonable and necessary for the digital music provider to engage in covered activities licensed under this subsection, solely for the purpose of engaging in such covered activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) does not cover or include any rights or uses other than those described in clauses (i) and (ii).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Other licenses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A voluntary license for covered activities entered into by or under the authority of 1 or more copyright owners and 1 or more digital music providers, or authority to make and distribute permanent downloads of a musical work obtained by a digital music provider from a sound recording copyright owner pursuant to an individual download license, shall be given effect in lieu of a blanket license under this subsection with respect to the musical works (or shares thereof) covered by such voluntary license or individual download authority and the following conditions apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Where a voluntary license or individual download license applies, the license authority provided under the blanket license shall exclude any musical works (or shares thereof) subject to the voluntary license or individual download license.</p>

If the deficiency has been cured, the mechanical licensing collective shall so confirm in writing, and the license shall be effective as of the date that the original notice of license was provided by the digital music provider.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) A digital music provider that believes a notice of license was improperly rejected by the mechanical licensing collective may seek review of such rejection in an appropriate district court of the United States. The district court shall determine the matter de novo based on the record before the mechanical licensing collective and any additional evidence presented by the parties.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) The qualified auditor shall determine the accuracy of royalty payments, including whether an underpayment or overpayment of royalties was made by the digital music provider to the mechanical licensing collective, except that, before providing a final audit report to the mechanical licensing collective, the qualified auditor shall provide a tentative draft of the report to the digital music provider and allow the digital music provider a reasonable opportunity to respond to the findings, including by clarifying issues and correcting factual errors.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">house report no. 94&ndash;1476</h4>
<p class="note-body">The provisions of section 1(e) and 101(e) of the present law [sections 1(e) and 101(e) of former title 17], establishing a system of compulsory licensing for the making and distribution of phonorecords of copyrighted music, are retained with a number of modifications and clarifications in section 115 of the bill. Under these provisions, which represented a compromise of the most controversial issue of the 1909 act, a musical composition that has been reproduced in phonorecords with the permission of the copyright owner may generally be reproduced in phonorecords by another person, if that person notifies the copyright owner and pays a specified royalty.</p>
<p class="note-body">The fundamental question of whether to retain the compulsory license or to do away with it altogether was a major issue during earlier stages of the program for general revision of the copyright law. At the hearings it was apparent that the argument on this point had shifted, and the real issue was not whether to retain the compulsory license but how much the royalty rate under it should be. The arguments for and against retention of the compulsory license are outlined at pages 66&ndash;67 of this Committee's 1967 report (H. Rept. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess.). The Committee's conclusion on this point remains the same as in 1967: &quot;that a compulsory licensing system is still warranted as a condition for the rights of reproducing and distributing phonorecords of copyrighted music,&quot; but &quot;that the present system is unfair and unnecessarily burdensome on copyright owners, and that the present statutory rate is too low.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Availability and Scope of Compulsory License.</strong> Subsection (a) of section 115 deals with three doubtful questions under the present law: (1) the nature of the original recording that will make the work available to others for recording under a compulsory license; (2) the nature of the sound recording that can be made under a compulsory license; and (3) the extent to which someone acting under a compulsory license can depart from the work as written or recorded without violating the copyright owner's right to make an &quot;arrangement&quot; or other derivative work. The first two of these questions are answered in clause (1) of section 115(a), and the third is the subject of clause (2).</p>
<p class="note-body">The present law, though not altogether clear, apparently bases compulsory licensing on the making or licensing of the first recording, even if no authorized records are distributed to the public. The first sentence of section 115(a)(1) would change the basis for compulsory licensing to authorized public distribution of phonorecords (including disks and audio tapes but not the sound tracks or other sound records accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work). Under the clause, a compulsory license would be available to anyone as soon as &quot;phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have been distributed to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence of clause (1), which has been the subject of some debate, provides that &quot;a person may obtain a compulsory license only if his or her primary purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private use.&quot; This provision was criticized as being discriminatory against background music systems, since it would prevent a background music producer from making recordings without the express consent of the copyright owner; it was argued that this could put the producer at a great competitive disadvantage with performing rights societies, allow discrimination, and destroy or prevent entry of businesses. The committee concluded, however, that the purpose of the compulsory license does not extend to manufacturers of phonorecords that are intended primarily for commercial use, including not only broadcasters and jukebox operators but also background music services.</p>
<p class="note-body">The final sentence of clause (1) provides that a person may not obtain a compulsory license for use of the work in the duplication of a sound recording made by another, unless the sound recording being duplicated was itself fixed lawfully and the making of phonorecords duplicated from it was authorized by the owner of copyright in the sound recording (or, if the recording was fixed before February 15, 1972, by the voluntary or compulsory licensee of the music used in the recording). The basic intent of this sentence is to make clear that a person is not entitled to a compulsory license of copyrighted musical works for the purpose of making an unauthorized duplication of a musical sound recording originally developed and produced by another. It is the view of the Committee that such was the original intent of the Congress in enacting the 1909 Copyright Act, and it has been so construed by the 3d, 5th, 9th and 10th Circuits in the following cases: <i>Duchess Music Corp. v. Stern</i>, 458 F.2d 1305 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 847 (1972) [93 S.Ct. 52, 34 L.Ed.2d 88]; <i>Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Colorado Magnetics, Inc</i>., 497 F.2d 285, aff'd on rehearing en banc, 497 F.2d 292 (10th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1120 (1975) [95 S.Ct. 801, 42 L.Ed.2d 819]; <i>Jondora Music Publishing Co. v. Melody Recordings, Inc</i>., 506 F.2d 392 (3d Cir. 1974, as amended 1975), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 1012 (1975) [95 S.Ct. 2417, 44 L.Ed.2d 680]; and <i>Fame Publishing Co. v. Alabama Custom Tape, Inc</i>., 507 F.2d 667 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 841 (1975) [96 S.Ct. 73, 46 L.Ed.2d 61].</p>
<p class="note-body">Under this provision, it would be possible to obtain a compulsory license for the use of copyrighted music under section 115 if the owner of the sound recording being duplicated authorizes its duplication. This does not, however, in any way require the owner of the original sound recording to grant a license to duplicate the original sound recording. It is not intended that copyright protection for sound recordings be circumscribed by requiring the owners of sound recordings to grant a compulsory license to unauthorized duplicators or others.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second clause of subsection (a) is intended to recognize the practical need for a limited privilege to make arrangements of music being used under a compulsory license, but without allowing the music to be perverted, distorted, or travestied. Clause (2) permits arrangements of a work &quot;to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved,&quot; so long as it does not &quot;change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work.&quot; The provision also prohibits the compulsory licensee from claiming an independent copyright in his arrangement as a &quot;derivative work&quot; without the express consent of the copyright owner.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Procedure for Obtaining Compulsory License.</strong> Section 115(b)(1) requires anyone who wishes to take advantage of the compulsory licensing provisions to serve a &quot;notice of intention to obtain a compulsory license,&quot; which is much like the &quot;notice of intention to use&quot; required by the present law. Under section 115, the notice must be served before any phonorecords are distributed, but service can take place &quot;before or within 30 days after making&quot; any phonorecords. The notice is to be served on the copyright owner, but if the owner is not identified in the Copyright Office records, &quot;it shall be sufficient to file the notice of intention in the Copyright Office.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee deleted clause (2) of section 115(b) of S. 22 as adopted by the Senate. The provision was a vestige of jukebox provisions in earlier bills, and its requirements no longer served any useful purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (2) [formerly clause (3)] of section 115(b) [cl. (2) of subsec. (b) of this section] provides that &quot;failure to serve or file the notice required by clause (1) *&#160;*&#160;* forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license and, in the absence of a negotiated license, renders the making and distribution of phonorecords actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506.&quot; The remedies provided in section 501 are those applicable to infringements generally.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:102 --><p class="note-body"><strong>Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License. <i>Identification of Copyright Owner</i></strong>.&mdash;Under the present law a copyright owner is obliged to file a &quot;notice of use&quot; in the Copyright Office, stating that the initial recording of the copyrighted work has been made or licensed, in order to recover against an unauthorized record manufacturer. This requirement has resulted in a technical loss of rights in some cases, and serves little or no purpose where the registration and assignment records of the Copyright Office already show the facts of ownership. Section 115(c)(1) therefore drops any formal &quot;notice of use&quot; requirements and merely provides that, &quot;to be entitled to receive royalties under a compulsory license, the copyright owner must be identified in the registration or other public records of the Copyright Office.&quot; On the other hand, since proper identification is an important precondition of recovery, the bill further provides that &quot;the owner is entitled to royalties for phonorecords manufactured and distributed after being so identified, but is not entitled to recover for any phonorecords previously made and distributed.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body"><i>Basis of Royalty</i>.&mdash;Under the present statute the specified royalty is payable &quot;on each such part manufactured,&quot; regardless of how many &quot;parts&quot; (i.e., records) are sold. This basis for calculating the royalty has been revised in section 115(c)(2) to provide that &quot;the royalty under a compulsory license shall be payable for every phonorecord made and distributed in accordance with the license.&quot; This basis is more compatible with the general practice in negotiated licenses today. It is unjustified to require a compulsory licensee to pay license fees on records which merely go into inventory, which may later be destroyed, and from which the record producer gains no economic benefit.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is intended that the Register of Copyrights will prescribe regulations insuring that copyright owners will receive full and prompt payment for all phonorecords made and distributed. Section 115(c)(2) states that &quot;a phonorecord is considered &apos;distributed&apos; if the person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted with its possession.&quot; For this purpose, the concept of &quot;distribution&quot; comprises any act by which the person exercising the compulsory license voluntarily relinquishes possession of a phonorecord (considered as a fungible unit), regardless of whether the distribution is to the public, passes title, constitutes a gift, or is sold, rented, leased, or loaned, unless it is actually returned and the transaction cancelled. Neither involuntary relinquishment, as through theft or fire, nor the destruction of unwanted records, would constitute &quot;distribution.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body">The term &quot;made&quot; is intended to be broader than &quot;manufactured,&quot; and to include within its scope every possible manufacturing or other process capable of reproducing a sound recording in phonorecords. The use of the phrase &quot;made and distributed&quot; establishes the basis upon which the royalty rate for compulsory licensing under section 115 is to be calculated, but it is in no way intended to weaken the liability of record pressers and other manufacturers and makers of phonorecords for copyright infringement where the compulsory licensing requirements have not been met. As under the present law, even if a presser, manufacturer, or other maker had no role in the distribution process, that person would be regarded as jointly and severally liable in a case where the court finds that infringement has taken place because of failure to comply with the provisions of section 115.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under existing practices in the record industry, phonorecords are distributed to wholesalers and retailers with the privilege of returning unsold copies for credit or exchange. As a result, the number of recordings that have been &quot;permanently&quot; distributed will not usually be known until some time&mdash;six or seven months on the average&mdash;after the initial distribution. In recognition of this problem, it has become a well-established industry practice, under negotiated licenses, for record companies to maintain reasonable reserves of the mechanical royalties due the copyright owners, against which royalties on the returns can be offset. The Committee recognizes that this practice may be consistent with the statutory requirements for monthly compulsory license accounting reports, but recognizes the possibility that, without proper safeguards, the maintenance of such reserves could be manipulated to avoid making payments of the full amounts owing to copyright owners. Under these circumstances, the regulations prescribed by the Register of Copyrights should contain detailed provisions ensuring that the ultimate disposition of every phonorecord made under a compulsory license is accounted for, and that payment is made for every phonorecord &quot;voluntarily and permanently&quot; distributed. In particular, the Register should prescribe a point in time when, for accounting purposes under section 115, a phonorecord will be considered &quot;permanently distributed,&quot; and should prescribe the situations in which a compulsory licensee is barred from maintaining reserves (e.g., situations in which the compulsory licensee has frequently failed to make payments in the past.)</p>
<p class="note-body"><i>Rate of Royalty</i>.&mdash;A large preponderance of the extensive testimony presented to the Committee on section 115 was devoted to the question of the amount of the statutory royalty rate. An extensive review and analysis of the testimony and arguments received on this question appear in the 1974 Senate report (S. Rep. No. 94&ndash;473) at page 71&ndash;94.</p>
<p class="note-body">While upon initial review it might be assumed that the rate established in 1909 would not be reasonable at the present time, the committee believes that an increase in the mechanical royalty rate must be justified on the basis of existing economic conditions and not on the mere passage of 67 years. Following a thorough analysis of the problem, the Committee considers that an increase of the present two-cent royalty to a rate of 2&#190; cents (or .6 of one cent per minute or fraction of playing time) is justified. This rate will be subject to review by the Copyright Royalty Commission, as provided by section 801, in 1980 and at 10-year intervals thereafter.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Accounting and Payment of Royalties; Effect of Default.</strong> Clause (3) of Section 115(c) provides that royalty payments are to be made on a monthly basis, in accordance with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation. In order to increase the protection of copyright proprietors against economic harm from companies which might refuse or fail to pay their just obligations, compulsory licensees will also be required to make a detailed cumulative annual statement of account, certified by a Certified Public Accountant.</p>
<p class="note-body">A source of criticism with respect to the compulsory licensing provisions of the present statute has been the rather ineffective sanctions against default by compulsory licensees. Clause (4) of section 115(c) corrects this defect by permitting the copyright owner to serve written notice on a defaulting licensee, and by providing for termination of the compulsory license if the default is not remedied within 30 days after notice is given. Termination under this clause &quot;renders either the making or the distribution, or both, of all phonorecords for which the royalty had not been paid, actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506.&quot;</p>
