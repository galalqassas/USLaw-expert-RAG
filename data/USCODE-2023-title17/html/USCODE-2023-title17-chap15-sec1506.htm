<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Conflicting precedent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If it appears that there may be conflicting judicial precedent on an issue of substantive copyright law that cannot be reconciled, the Copyright Claims Board shall follow the law of the Federal jurisdiction in which the action could have been brought if filed in a district court of the United States, or, if the action could have been brought in more than 1 such jurisdiction, the jurisdiction that the Copyright Claims Board determines has the most significant ties to the parties and conduct at issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Record</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Copyright Claims Board shall maintain records documenting the proceedings before the Board.</p>
