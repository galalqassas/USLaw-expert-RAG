<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">house report no. 94&ndash;1476</h4>
<p class="note-body">Chapter 7 entitled &quot;Copyright Office,&quot; sets forth the administrative and housekeeping provisions of the bill.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Administrative Procedure Act.</strong> Under an amendment to section 701 adopted by the Committee, the Copyright Office is made fully subject to the Administrative Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. and 701 et seq.] with one exception: under section 706(b), reproduction and distribution of copyright deposit copies would be made under the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552] only to the extent permitted by the Copyright Office regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Retention and Disposition of Deposited Articles.</strong> A recurring problem in the administration of the copyright law has been the need to reconcile the storage limitations of the Copyright Office with the continued value of deposits in identifying copyrighted works. Aside from its indisputable utility to future historians and scholars, a substantially complete collection of both published and unpublished deposits, other than those selected by the Library of Congress, would avoid the many difficulties encountered when copies needed for identification in connection with litigation or other purposes have been destroyed. The basic policy behind section 704 is that copyright deposits should be retained as long as possible, but that the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress should be empowered to dispose of them under appropriate safeguards when they decide that it has become necessary to do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (a) of section 704, any copy, phonorecord, or identifying material deposited for registration, whether registered or not, becomes &quot;the property of the United States Government.&quot; This means that the copyright owner or person who made the deposit cannot demand its return as a matter of right, even in rejection cases, although the provisions of section 407 and 408 are flexible enough to allow for special arrangements in exceptional cases. On the other hand, Government ownership of deposited articles under section 704(a) carries with it no privileges under the copyright itself; use of a deposited article in violation of the copyright owner's exclusive rights would be infringement.</p>
<p class="note-body">With respect to published works, section 704(b) makes all deposits available to the Library of Congress &quot;for its collections, or for exchanges or transfer to any other library&quot;; where the work is unpublished, the Library is authorized to select any deposit for its own collections or for transfer to the National Archives of the United States or to a Federal records center.</p>
<p class="note-body">Motion picture producers have expressed some concern lest the right to transfer copies of works, such as motion pictures, that have been published under rental, lease, or loan arrangements, might lead to abuse. However, the Library of Congress has not knowingly transferred works of this sort to other libraries in the past, and there is no reason to expect it to do so in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee added a new subsection (c) to section 704, under which the Register is authorized to make microfilm or other record copies of copyright deposits before transferring or otherwise disposing of them.</p>
<p class="note-body">For deposits not selected by the Library, subsection (d) provides that they, or &quot;identifying portions or reproductions of them,&quot; are to be retained under Copyright Office control &quot;for the longest period considered practicable and desirable&quot; by the Register and the Librarian. When and if they ultimately decide that retention of certain deposited articles is no longer &quot;practicable and desirable,&quot; the Register and Librarian have joint discretion to order their &quot;destruction or other disposition.&quot; Because of the unique value and irreplaceable nature of unpublished deposits, the subsection prohibits their intentional destruction during their copyright term, unless a facsimile reproduction has been made.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) of section 704 establishes a new procedure under which a copyright owner can request retention of deposited material for the full term of copyright. The Register of Copyrights is authorized to issue regulations prescribing the fees for this service and the &quot;conditions under which such requests are to be made and granted.&quot;</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Catalog of Copyright Entries.</strong> Section 707(a) of the bill retains the present statute's basis requirement that the Register compile and publish catalogs of all copyright registrations at periodic intervals, but provides for &quot;discretion to determine, on the basis of practicability and usefulness the form and frequency of publication of each particular part&quot;. This provision will in no way diminish the utility or value of the present catalogs, and the flexibility of approach, coupled with use of the new mechanical and electronic devices now becoming available, will avoid waste and result in a better product.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Copyright Office Fees.</strong> The schedule of fees set out in section 708 reflects a general increase in the fees of the Copyright Office from those established by the Congress in 1965. The basic fees are $10 for registration, $6 for renewal registration, $10 for recordation of documents and $10 per hour for searching. The section also contains new fee provisions needed because of new requirements or services established under the bill, and subsection (a)(11) authorizes the Register to fix additional fees, on the &quot;basis of the cost of providing the service,&quot; &quot;for any other special services requiring a substantial amount of time or expense.&quot; Subsection (b) makes clear that, except for the possibility of waivers in &quot;occasional or isolated cases involving relatively small amounts,&quot; the Register is to charge fees for services rendered to other Government agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Postal Interruptions.</strong> Section 709 authorizes the Register of Copyrights to issue regulation to permit the acceptance by the Copyright Office of documents which are delivered after the close of the prescribed period if the delay was caused by a general disruption or suspension of postal or other transportation or communications services.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>Reproductions for the Blind and Handicapped.</strong> Section 710 directs the Register of Copyrights to establish by regulation forms and procedures by which the copyright owners of certain categories of works may voluntarily grant to the Library of Congress a license to reproduce and distribute copies or phonorecords of the work solely for the use of the blind and physically handicapped.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Register is authorized to fix fees for other services, including the cost of preparing copies of Copyright Office records, whether or not such copies are certified, based on the cost of providing the service. Fees established under paragraphs (10) and (11) shall be reasonable and may not exceed one-half of the cost necessary to cover reasonable expenses incurred by the Copyright Office for the collection and administration of the statements of account and any royalty fees deposited with such statements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Adjustment of Fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Register of Copyrights may, by regulation, adjust the fees for the services specified in paragraphs (1) through (9) of subsection (a) in the following manner:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Register shall conduct a study of the costs incurred by the Copyright Office for the registration of claims, the recordation of documents, and the provision of services. The study shall also consider the timing of any adjustment in fees and the authority to use such fees consistent with the budget.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Register may, on the basis of the study under paragraph (1), and subject to paragraph (5), adjust fees to not more than that necessary to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office for the services <!-- PDFPage:186 -->described in paragraph (1), plus a reasonable inflation adjustment to account for any estimated increase in costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any fee established under paragraph (2) shall be rounded off to the nearest dollar, or for a fee less than $12, rounded off to the nearest 50 cents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Fees established under this subsection shall be fair and equitable and give due consideration to the objectives of the copyright system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If the Register determines under paragraph (2) that fees should be adjusted, the Register shall prepare a proposed fee schedule and submit the schedule with the accompanying economic analysis to the Congress. The fees proposed by the Register may be instituted after the end of 120 days after the schedule is submitted to the Congress unless, within that 120-day period, a law is enacted stating in substance that the Congress does not approve the schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The fees prescribed by or under this section are applicable to the United States Government and any of its agencies, employees, or officers, but the Register of Copyrights has discretion to waive the requirement of this subsection in occasional or isolated cases involving relatively small amounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), all fees received under this section shall be deposited by the Register of Copyrights in the Treasury of the United States and shall be credited to the appropriations for necessary expenses of the Copyright Office. Such fees that are collected shall remain available until expended. The Register may, in accordance with regulations that he or she shall prescribe, refund any sum paid by mistake or in excess of the fee required by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of fees deposited against future services, the Register of Copyrights shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in interest-bearing securities in the United States Treasury any portion of the fees that, as determined by the Register, is not required to meet current deposit account demands. Funds from such portion of fees shall be invested in securities that permit funds to be available to the Copyright Office at all times if they are determined to be necessary to meet current deposit account demands. Such investments shall be in public debt securities with maturities suitable to the needs of the Copyright Office, as determined by the Register of Copyrights, and bearing interest at rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The income on such investments shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States and shall be credited to the appropriations for necessary expenses of the Copyright Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In this subsection, the term &quot;covered competition&quot; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an art competition sponsored by the Congressional Institute that is open only to high school students; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the competition established under section 3 of House Resolution 77, 113th Congress, agreed to February 26, 2013.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to a work that wins a covered competition, the Register of Copyrights&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall waive the requirement under subsection (a)(1) with respect to an application for registration of a copyright claim for that work if that application is submitted to the Copyright Office not later than the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the work claimed by the application wins the covered competition (referred to in this paragraph as the &quot;covered year&quot;); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may waive a fee described in subparagraph (A) for an application submitted after the end of the covered year if the fee would have been waived under that subparagraph had the application been submitted before the last day of the covered year.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, on or before December 31, 2021, the Register of Copyrights determines that a national emergency declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) generally disrupts or suspends the ordinary functioning of the copyright system under this title, or any component thereof, including on a regional basis, the Register may, on a temporary basis, toll, waive, adjust, or modify any timing provision (including any deadline or effective period, except as provided in subsection (c)) or procedural provision contained in this title or chapters II or III of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, for no longer than the Register reasonably determines to be appropriate to mitigate the impact of the disruption caused by the national emergency. In taking such action, the Register shall consider the scope and severity of the particular national emergency, and its specific effect with respect to the particular provision, and shall tailor any remedy accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice and Effect</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any action taken by the Register in response to a national emergency pursuant to subsection (a) shall not be subject to section 701(e) or subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, and chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The provision of general public notice detailing the action being taken by the Register in response to the national emergency under subsection (a) is sufficient to effectuate such action. The Register may make such action effective both prospectively and retroactively in relation to a particular provision as the Register determines to be appropriate based on the timing, scope, and nature of the public emergency, but any action by the Register may only be retroactive with respect to a deadline that has not already passed before the declaration described in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Statement Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (d), not later than 20 days after taking any action that results in a provision being modified for a cumulative total of longer than 120 days, the Register shall submit to Congress a statement detailing the action taken, the relevant background, and rationale for the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Register to act under subsection (a) does not extend&#160;<sup><a href="#710_1_target" name="710_1">1</a></sup> provisions under this title requiring the commencement of an action or proceeding in Federal court within a specified period of time, except that if the Register adjusts the license availability date defined in section 115(e)(15), such adjustment shall not affect the ability to commence actions for any claim of infringement of exclusive rights provided by paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 106 against a digital music provider arising from the unauthorized reproduction or distribution of a musical work by such digital music provider in the course of engaging in covered activities that accrued after January 1, 2018, provided that such action is commenced within the time periods prescribed under section 115(d)(10)(C)(i) or 115(d)(10)(C)(ii) as calculated from the adjusted license availability date. If the Register adjusts the license availability date, the Register must provide the statement to Congress under subsection (c) at the same time as the public notice <!-- PDFPage:189 -->of such adjustment with a detailed explanation of why such adjustment is needed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Copyright Term Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Register to act under subsection (a) does not extend to provisions under chapter 3, except section 304(c), or section 1401(a)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Other Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), the authority of the Register under subsection (a) is not contingent on a specification made by the President under such section or any other requirement under that Act (other than the emergency declaration under section 201(a) of such Act (50 U.S.C. 1621(a))). The authority described in this section supersedes the authority of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.).</p>
