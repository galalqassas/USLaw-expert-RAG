<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Certificate of Registration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a claimant or counterclaimant in a proceeding before the Copyright Claims Board shall be eligible to recover actual damages and profits or statutory damages under this chapter for infringement of a work if the requirements of subsection (a) have been met, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Copyright Claims Board may not render a determination in the proceeding until&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the other parties to the proceeding have been provided an opportunity to address the registration certificate;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the proceeding may not proceed further because a registration certificate for the work is pending, the proceeding shall be held in abeyance pending submission of the certificate to the Copyright Claims Board, except that, if the proceeding is held in abeyance for more than 1 year, the Copyright Claims Board may, upon providing written notice to the parties to the proceeding, and 30 days to the parties to respond to the notice, dismiss the proceeding without prejudice; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the Copyright Claims Board receives notice that registration with respect to the <!-- PDFPage:242 -->work has been refused, the proceeding shall be dismissed without prejudice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to ensure that actions before the Copyright Claims Board proceed in a timely manner, the Register of Copyrights shall establish regulations allowing the Copyright Office to make a decision, on an expedited basis, to issue or deny copyright registration for an unregistered work that is at issue before the Board.</p>
